# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is a dataset that is about cholestrol and heart faliures. I want to gain more insight on how different factors impact resting heart rate, cholestrol and blood pressure.  


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * What is the impact of being a certain gender on the resting heart rate?
 * How does age impact cholestrol levels?
 * How does age impact resting heart rate?
 * How does age impact blood pressure?

## Sketches

These are some graphs that I have sketched, and are the graphs that I plan on adding to my portfolio.

This is another graph I sketched in ms paint. 


## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a bar chart and it shows Males vs Females with their resting heart rate.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

I think one thing I am worried about is thinking if my plot is too simple from drawing conclusions or making interpretations. Its just a bar plot that compares the 2 sexes. 

However, I know that there will be 3 other visualizations that I want to make, so I'm not too worried about it. 

## Milestones

September: Finish up visualization 1 and 2
October: Finish up visualization 3 and 4
November: Maybe add some interactive elements?
December: Finalizing Porfolio and polishing it up
